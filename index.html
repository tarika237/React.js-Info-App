        <h1> React.js</h1>
        </div>
        <p>React.js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications.
        Itâ€™s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. 
        React was first created a software engineer working for Facebook.

        <h2>What is JSX?</h2>
        <p>
            We studied that JSX is a declarative language which combines both HTML and JavaScript.
            Engineers at Facebook created JSX and a new mobile development
            framework called React Native to help build complex apps in an easy way.
            We wrote the JSX and React Native code on 'Snack',an online editor which allows us to write and compile React
            Native code in an online environment. We can also preview the output of the code using Snack.
            On the left side we see our files,in the middle is the workspace in which we write the code 
            and on the right we see the output of the written code.
            You can see output for Android/iOS/Web.
        </p>
        </div>

        <h3> The code </h3>
        <p>
            The first line is a Component.
            Component is a base class from this we take the React components.
            Component class is defined in the React library. You can see how React and Component
            library is imported from the React library in line 1.

            In line no.2 we are importing the Button,View,Text from the React Native Library.
            The text Tag is predefined in the Library called React Native.
            It allows you write on the screen.
            The render() is like a function we write.
            Line no.4 means that class pinkbutton extends the base class which is the Component
            Then we are working on the styling of the pinkbutton meaning the color for it and in the next function
            it padding,margin etc.
             We  can see the output on the right.

            When we put {} it means we are writing JS inside the JSX.
            When we put tags it means we are writing HTML.
            When we are rendering components using JSX tags (<Text>), we can write/execute
            Javascript inside the {}.
            You see two {{ }} because one {} says that we are going to write javascript code. The other {}
            is for the json object.
